        # The __next__() method also allows you to do operations, and must return the next item in the sequence
        # In the __next__() method, we can add a terminating condition to raise an error if the iteration is done a specified number of times:

"""
Overview of Python
"""

    # Python is an interpreted programming language. This means that each line of code is executed one by one.
    # A compiler takes high-level code and turns it into a lower-level code
    # An interpreter read code and translates it line-by-lne into code that can be executed by the computer
    # compiled programming language process: source code program-->compiler-->intermediate file-->interpreter-->output
    # interpreted programming language process: source code program-->interpreter-->output

    # The reason why Python is termed as an interpreted language is that the compiler in Python does relatively less work than an interpreter.
    # In Python, compilation takes place where the code compiles into a simpler form called bytecode which is a low-level code that can be executed by an interpreter.
    # The byte code is not really interpreted to machine code unless there is some kind of implementation like PyPy. Bytecodes are executed by Python Virtual Machine (PVM) which emulates a simplified execution environment.
    # The compilation process to bytecode is entirely implicit, meaning that you never invoke the compiler. Rather, you simply run a .py file.
    # The lack of an explicit compile step is why the Python executable is known as the Python interpreter.
    # The first step of an interpreter is to read a Python code or instruction.
    # It then checks the syntax of each line and verifies if the instruction is well-formatted.
    # The interpreter can display the errors of each line one by one.



"""
Collections
"""

    # The collection Module in Python provides different types of containers
    # A Container is an object that is used to store different objects and provide a way to access the contained objects and iterate over them
    # Examples of built-in containers are Tuple, List, Sets, and Dictionary
    # There are also 5 other containers in the collection module: counter, deque, namedTuple(), orderedDict, defaultdict

    # counter
        # a counter is a sub-class of the dictionary by keeping the count of the elements in an iterable in the form of an unordered dictionary
        # the key represents the element in the iterable and value represents the count of that element in the iterable
        # import the counter class from the collections module
        from collections import Counter
